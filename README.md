# Light Intensity Meter

A digital light meter is a device which is used to measure the intensity of a source of light. The light that falls on to the photocell or sensor contains energy which is transformed into electric current. Indeed, the measure of current depends on the intensity of light that strokes the photocell or light sensor. Light meters read the electrical current, calculate the acceptable value and show this value on its display.
